# python-web3-app

Work in progress: Vibe coding a Python web3 app. This is a learning exercise where I used AI to help guide me through the process of developing an app that queries the blockchain. As someone actively learning Python, this was very helpful for me and I made sure to add comments on every line to document what the code does. I also used FastAPI to automatically generate API docs.
